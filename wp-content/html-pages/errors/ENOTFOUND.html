    wp-now: Error starting: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND
</code>

# Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND

This error occurs when the server is unable to resolve the hostname. 
This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as a misconfigured DNS server, a typo in the hostname, or a network issue.

In the context of wp-now, this error can occur when trying to start the server with a custom URL that is not properly configured.

<h2>
    Defining Custom URLs
</h2>

Here is an example of a Blueprint that defines custom URL constant. wp-now will automatically detect the blueprint and execute it after starting the server. In consequence, the site will be available at http://myurl.wpnow. Make sure myurl.wpnow is added to your hosts file.
